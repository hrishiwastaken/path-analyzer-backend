The Path Tracer: A Visual Toolkit for Curve Analysis


Ever looked at a winding road, a painted line, or even a crack in the pavement and thought, "I need to turn that into data"? No? Well, now you can anyway.

The Path Tracer is a desktop application built for the meticulous task of extracting a 2D path from an image, smoothing it into a mathematically perfect curve, analyzing its geometric properties, and exporting it for real-world applications, like telling a robot where to go.

It's part image processor, part interactive analysis tool, and part data-exporting workhorse.


Core Features

Interactive Color-Based Path Extraction: Forget manual tracing. Use intuitive sliders to isolate any colored path in your image with a live preview. Find that perfect shade of "racetrack gray" or "garden-hose green".

Intelligent Skeletonization: The tool automatically finds the one-pixel-wide centerline of your selected path, providing a clean, raw dataset to work from. No more chunky, ambiguous lines.

Point-and-Click Path Definition: Once the raw path is found, you are the director. Simply hover and click to define the exact start and end points of the segment you care about. The tool will intelligently order all the points in between.

Silky-Smooth Spline Fitting: Raw pixel data is noisy. The Path Tracer uses SciPy's powerful spline fitting algorithms to transform your jagged, pixelated line into a continuous, differentiable curve, perfect for calculating derivatives.

Deep-Dive Slope Analysis: Launch a dedicated side-by-side analysis window. Drag a slider along your path and watch in real-time as the tangent, slope, and angle are calculated and visualized on both the original image and a clean mathematical plot. The plot even rotates intelligently to give you the most intuitive representation of slope.

Robotics-Ready CSV Export: The ultimate goal. Export your smooth path as a CSV file containing a list of waypoints. Each point includes its X/Y coordinates, the distance from the previous point, and the turning angle required to get thereâ€”everything a simple vehicle controller needs to follow the path.



The Grand Tour: A Step-by-Step Workflow


Using the Path Tracer is a straightforward, four-step process.

Load Your Canvas (1. Load Image)

Start by loading any standard image file. The application will display it, ready for analysis

Isolate Your Subject (2. Tune Color Range...)

Open the Color Tuner window. Adjust the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) sliders until the path you want to analyze is perfectly highlighted in white. When you're satisfied, hit "Apply".

Define the Journey (3. Analyze & Select Endpoints)

This is where the magic begins. The application will process the image based on your color selection and overlay a grid of potential nodes on the detected path.

First, hover and click on the node where you want your path to begin.

Next, hover and click on the node where you want it to end.

The application processes these points, orders the path, and fits a smooth red line through them.


Refine and Export (4. Export Path to CSV)

Use the "Path Endpoint Control" slider to fine-tune the length of the analyzed segment.

Dive into the "Interactive Slope Analysis" tool to inspect the curve's properties at any point.

Set your desired resolution using the "Export Path Resolution" slider.

Finally, click "Export Path to CSV" to save the motion-control data to a file.


Under the Hood


This tool is a testament to the power of Python's scientific and graphical libraries.

GUI: Tkinter

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

Numerical & Scientific Computing: NumPy, SciPy (for that sweet spline interpolation)

Plotting: Matplotlib


How to Run


No complex installation required. Just get the dependencies and run the script.(or just download the release binary lol)

1. Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy scipy matplotlib Pillow

3. Execution:
   
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., path_tracer.py) and run it from your terminal:

python path_tracer.py


Whether you're mapping a route for a small robot, analyzing biological structures, or just satisfying a deep-seated need to quantify squiggly lines, the Path Tracer is your go-to digital assistant.
